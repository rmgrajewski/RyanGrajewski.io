## Project Overview
This is an ongoing entrepreneurial project I started in High School out of my love for motorcycles. The goal is to purchase used mopeds and motorcycles off of Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace, develop a restoration plan involving purchase of required hardware as well as aesthetic parts, and re-sell on those same platforms for a profit. 

## Results

To date, I have profited a total of nearly $12,000 including the purchase of all tools and parts. I have successfully restored a total of 15 bikes, ranging from aesthetic repairs such as buffering, shining, and de-rusting, to mechanical repairs of carburetors, drive-belts, throttle mechanisms, and headlights. My favorite bike to repair was one I kept for my own - the Honda Rukkus!
