<span style="font-style:italics"><b>Note</b>: because this project is ongoing and comprises critical IP for one of UPS's newest package distribution technologies, I am only allowed to share limited details of my work.</span>

## Overview
For my main project at UPS, I was presented the very open ended engineering challenge of conceptualizing and prototyping a system that would integrate with a larger package handilng solution that was already in development. The objective for the project was to build a system that could accept packages from the output of one system, scan/identify critical information on the package, manipulate the package's orientation, and then dispense them into the opening of the next system with high repeatability.

My responsibility was to take these "it should do X" statements and fully articulate the scope of the system, conceptualize a system to satisfy the functional requirements, and build a working prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of the system within the physical limits of the project.

The system I developed has 5 total axes of motion, each driven individually by stepper motors via a series of belts and pulleys or lead screws. The system is capable of accepting a package in any random orientation and, after a sequence of rotations, dispensing the package in a uniform desired orientation. 

## Process 

I had the opportunity to develop this project for three full internship terms, having been given the rare opportunity to extend my original contract for Summer 2022 up through May 2023. At the beginning of each semester, I defined realistic goals for the project that I needed to achieve. These were:<br>
    -<b>Summer 2022</b>: Define functional requirements & explore design space, conceptualize in CAD the full system and its motions, begin prototyping the physical components (the first 3 motion axes)
    -<b>Fall 2022</b>: Develop (4th motion axis) physical components, develop motor controller electronics module, and program rudimentary test sequences
    -<b>Spring 2023</b>: Develop (5th motion axis) physical components, fully develop controller code to implement the logic algorithm, validate functionality with testing
